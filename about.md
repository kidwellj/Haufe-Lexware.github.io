### The Project

Funded by the AHRC under the follow-on funding for impact and engagement, this project arose out of a three year study of religious environmentalists in Scotland

### Project Team

This project is staffed by two scholar-activists:

#### Jeremy Kidwell

Lecturer in theological ethics at the University of Birmingham, Jeremy is passionate about synthesizing research and social action on things that matter. He is irredeemably interdisciplinary.

#### Michael Northcott

Professor of Ethics at the University of Edinburgh
