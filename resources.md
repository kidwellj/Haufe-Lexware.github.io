### Which Kind of Sustainability?

The "Finding Common Ground" project aims to develop new knowledge about collaborations across different kinds of low-carbon and sustainability groups. There are a huge variety of ways to care for the earth: growing food, reducing waste, participating in the sharing economy, protecting animals amd habitats, and many different kinds of groups which combine and emphasise different practices and strategies. By cultivating a better understanding of how groups like permaculture, transition, or eco-congregations work, we thing new kinds of regional collaborations can be unlocked. Never heard of an Eco-Congregation? Transition town? No problem! On this site, we will be gathering interviews, statistics, and research into all kinds of sustainability, keep an eye out for more here soon!
