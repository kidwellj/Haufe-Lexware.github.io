### Want to find common ground in your area?

The most important piece of this project consists of regional workshops across Scotland which we will be running in Spring 2007. If you would like us to come and run a workshop in your area we'd be delighted to respond to an invitation. Just email [jeremy](mailto:j.kidwell@bham.ac.uk) and we will take it from there!
